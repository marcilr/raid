  RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, originally Redundant
  Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a data storage virtualization
  technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components
  into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy,
  performance improvement, or both.
